The dataset structure is inspired by real-world deforestation datasets such as the Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Dataset13 and the Global Forest Watch platform3.

Additional features like carbon emissions and protected areas are derived from studies on deforestation


Year: The year of the data record (2015â€“2024).

Country: The country where deforestation is occurring.

Region: The specific region within the country.

Forest_Area_km2: Total forest area in square kilometers.

Population_Density: Population density (people per square kilometer).

Agricultural_Land_Percent: Percentage of land used for agriculture.

Rainfall_mm: Average annual rainfall in millimeters.

Temperature_C: Average annual temperature in degrees Celsius.

Road_Density_km_per_km2: Density of roads (kilometers per square kilometer).

Mining_Activity: Level of mining activity (0 to 1, where 1 is the highest).

Protected_Area_Percent: Percentage of land under protected status.

Deforestation_Rate: Annual percentage of forest area lost.

Fire_Incidents: Number of wildfire incidents in the region.

Logging_Activity: Level of logging activity (0 to 1, where 1 is the highest).

Urban_Expansion_Rate: Rate of urban expansion (percentage increase in urban area).

Carbon_Emissions_kt: Annual carbon emissions in kilotons.

Label: Target variable ("safe" or "danger") based on deforestation risk.
